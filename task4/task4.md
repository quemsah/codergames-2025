### Task: Midnight Spirits

#### Story:

"Midnight spirits."

At midnight, the spirits appeared in the streets, their pale shapes drifting through the shadows.

Domi knew he had to find a way home—one that kept him as far from danger as possible.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

### Task:

The map to Domi's home is represented by a maze of cells, where each cell has a numeric value indicating the danger level of the cell.

You must find the safest path (i.e., the one with the lowest total danger value) from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix.

In this challenge, you can only move right or down (you cannot move back or diagonally), and you must calculate the total danger level of the safest path.

The map is represented by an n x m matrix where each cell is a positive number representing the danger level of that cell on the map.

And you have to return the total danger value of the safest path from the top-left corner (position \[0\]\[0\]) to the bottom-right corner (position \[n-1\]\[m-1\]) and the safest path coordinations.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

#### Example:

Input:

map = \[

\[1, 3, 1\],

\[1, 5, 1\],

  \[4, 2, 1\],

\]

Output:

7

\[0, 0\]

\[0, 1\]

\[0, 2\]

\[1, 2\]

\[2, 2\]

Correct answer:

Total danger value of the safest path : 0,2 points

Safest path coordinations : 0,3 points

\----------

Total for every case : 0,5 points
